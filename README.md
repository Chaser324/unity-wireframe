These are general purpose wireframe shaders adapted from Unity's built-in SpatialMappingWireframe shader.

## Requirements

* These shaders will only work on devices that support at least Shader Model 4.0. Most mobile devices do not meet this requirement.

## Installation

* Download from the package manager using the url: https://github.com/insominx/unity-wireframe.git?path=/Packages/unity-wireframe

## Usage

* Add the `Wireframe` directory to your Unity project's `Assets` directory.
* To use the wireframe shaders, set your material's shader to `SuperSystems/Wireframe`, `SuperSystems/Wireframe-Transparent`, or `SuperSystems/Wireframe-Transparent-Culled`.
* To use the replacement shader image effect, add the `WireframeImageEffect` component to your camera. Some other effects like GlobalFog will interfere with the replacement shaders and will need to be disabled.
